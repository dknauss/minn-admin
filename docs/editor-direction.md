# Editor direction

**Decision: keep and deepen Minn's own editor. Use Gutenberg as the escape hatch, not the foundation.**

## The options considered

1. **Embed the block editor** (`@wordpress/edit-post` or an iframe of `post.php`). Full block
   fidelity, but it drags in React, the build toolchain, and the exact visual noise Minn exists to
   remove. An iframed wp-admin inside Minn is two admins fighting in one window.
2. **Rebuild block support piecemeal in the custom editor.** Chasing full parity with Gutenberg
   (nested layouts, patterns, dynamic blocks) is a treadmill we would never get off.
3. **Hybrid (chosen).** Minn's editor owns the *writing* use case — the 90% of edits that are
   paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes, code and images. It reads and writes native Gutenberg
   block markup for that subset, so nothing is proprietary and every post remains fully editable
   in Gutenberg at any time. Anything beyond the safe subset (`SIMPLE_BLOCKS` in `app.js`) locks
   the body read-only and hands off to the real block editor with one click.

## Why hybrid wins

- **Interop is guaranteed by the storage format.** Minn writes `<!-- wp:paragraph -->`-style
  markup that `parse_blocks()` validates. There is no lock-in and no migration.
- **The lock is the safety valve.** `editorModeFor()` classifies content as `classic` / `blocks` /
  `locked`. Locked posts never have their content sent on save, so a complex layout can't be
  damaged by Minn — worst case you click through to Gutenberg.
- **No build step.** The whole app stays a single vanilla-JS file, which is the plugin's core
  architectural bet.

## Block islands — how complex content became safe to edit

The original design locked the whole body when any complex block appeared. That's now replaced
by **atomic block islands**:

1. `tokenizeBlocks()` splits raw content into top-level segments and verifies the segments
   reassemble the original byte-for-byte (fails → the old locked mode, now rare).
2. Simple, attribute-safe blocks become editable HTML. A simple block carrying attributes the
   serializer can't reproduce (`{"fontSize":"large"}`, image `{"id":…}`) is *not* edited lossily —
   it becomes an island too (`segmentEditable()` / `EDITABLE_ATTRS`).
3. Everything else renders as a `contenteditable="false"` island — a bordered card with the block
   name chip and a static preview — whose original markup is stored verbatim and spliced back
   unchanged on save. Deleting an island deletes the block; nothing else can happen to it.

The result: text edits flow *around* complex layouts with zero risk to them. Verified by
byte-comparing nested group/columns and shortcode blocks through a full edit-and-save cycle.
Known cosmetic effect: the first Minn save normalizes inter-block whitespace to the Gutenberg
standard blank line.

## Where the line moves over time

Grow `SIMPLE_BLOCKS` and `EDITABLE_ATTRS` deliberately, one block/attribute at a time, only when
the round-trip is proven safe. Islands make the cost of *not* supporting a block small — it still
displays and survives — so there is no pressure to chase parity. If a site's content is mostly
complex layouts, Gutenberg is simply the right tool and Minn should be great at everything
*around* the editor.
